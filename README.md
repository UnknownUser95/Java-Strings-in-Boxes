# Java-Strings-in-Boxes

A library for putting strings into various boxes.

There is only one class with essentially three options:

- createBox
- createHorizontalMultiBox
- createVerticalMultiBox

All of them take an array or a list of strings and then return the specified box with the strings in it.

This was initially designed for a project, but I thought it's good enough for a standalone release.
